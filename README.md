# pheartok.github.io  
A fully static, zero‑maintenance website for Twitch streamer **Pheartok** — a wandering lone wolf moving through MMO worlds with quiet intensity and deliberate purpose. This site is built for GitHub Pages using lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend, no databases, and nothing to break.

## About the Project
This repository powers the official home of **Pheartok**, a streamer who drifts through digital landscapes the way a ghost moves through old forests — silent, focused, and always deeper than expected. The site reflects that energy: minimal, sharp, and built to stay out of the way.

The design philosophy is simple:
- No noise  
- No clutter  
- No maintenance  
- Just a clean place for viewers to find the stream, the moments, and the story

## Features

- **Auto‑Updating Clips & VOD Links**

- **Lightweight & Fast**  
  Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks. No build steps. No dependencies.
