# pheartok.github.io
This a fully static, zero‑maintenance website for Twitch streamer Pheartok — a wandering lone wolf moving through MMO worlds with precision, intensity, and silence. Built for GitHub Pages, powered by simple HTML/CSS/JS, and designed to update itself through Twitch embeds and platform‑native feeds.
